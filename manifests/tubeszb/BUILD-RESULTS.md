# TubeZB beta build results

Verified 2026-09-13. **14/14 firmware builds succeeded**, as did the full workflow.

- [Workflow and downloadable artifacts](https://github.com/tube0013/silabs-firmware-builder/actions/runs/34775291246)
- Tested source commit: `ebd86babfee5e74571e86fd0aa0ed4a7e2ddc7dc`
- Artifacts: 14 firmware bundles (GBL, HEX, ELF/OUT), plus `manifest.json`.
- This record is a documentation-only follow-up to the tested source commit.
- Build success does not establish hardware behavior; nothing was flashed.

## CI fixes made during validation

Both workflows reuse Nabu Casa's published build image only when the dependency
hash matches exactly. Firmware matrices disable fail-fast to check every device.
Stable router key-table size is passed as a compiler define because that SDK
has no generated header override for it. Beta XNCP selects USART versus EUSART
headers and flow-control constants to support EUSART-only configurations.
Upstream extension vendor attribution remains unchanged.
